## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, user-friendly environment for self-learning and implementing algorithms and data structures.

It also includes an automated testing system using the GoogleTest (gtest) framework to verify the correctness of user implementations.

Users can develop their own algorithms or data structures and ensure they function correctly by running them against prepared test cases.

First of all, I want to implement algorithms of CSED331 course(algorithms, POSTECH).
